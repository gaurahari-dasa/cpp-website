                        Sri Chanchalapathi Dasa came across the teachings of
                        Srila Prabhupada while pursuing his studies at the
                        prestigious Indian Institute of Science and became
                        interested in his mission. As he gained a deeper
                        understanding of Srila Prabhupadaâ€™s philosophy and
                        ideals, he dedicated himself fully to the Krishna
                        consciousness movement. Thus, he joined ISKCON Bangalore
                        in 1984 and has been working tirelessly for the
                        betterment of humanity since then.
